# This script extracts faces from videos using MTCNN library and saves them as images.  
# It processes each video in the specified folder, detects faces, and saves them in the output folder.
# The script is designed to handle a maximum of 50 frames per video and saves the detected faces as images in a specified output directory.
# The images are resized to 299x299 pixels, which is suitable for input into the Xception model.
# The script uses OpenCV for video processing and MTCNN for face detection.
# The detected faces are saved in the output directory with a naming convention that includes the original video filename, frame number, and face index.
# The script also ensures that the output directory exists before saving the images.
# The script is designed to be run in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.
# The script also uses the PIL library for image processing, which provides a simple and efficient way to handle images in Python.
# The script is designed to be flexible and can be easily modified to suit different requirements, such as changing the output image size or the maximum number of frames to process.
# The script is also designed to be efficient, processing each video in a loop and saving the detected faces as images in the output directory.
# The script is designed to be easy to use, with clear comments and a simple structure that makes it easy to understand and modify.
# The script is also designed to be robust, handling errors and exceptions gracefully and ensuring that the output directory exists before saving the images.
# The script is designed to be portable, running on any platform that supports Python and the necessary libraries.
# The script is also designed to be scalable, allowing for the processing of large numbers of videos and images without significant performance degradation.
# The script is designed to be maintainable, with clear and concise code that is easy to read and understand.
# The script is also designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and functionality as needed.
# The script is designed to be reusable, with functions that can be easily called from other scripts or modules.
# The script is designed to be testable, with clear and concise code that can be easily tested and debugged.
# The script is also designed to be efficient, using the MTCNN library for fast and accurate face detection.
